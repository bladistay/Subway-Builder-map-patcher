## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
If you need to use this patcher with an older version of the game, please check the [Releases page](https://github.com/bladistay/Subway-Builder-map-patcher/releases) for version-specific instructions and compatible patcher versions.

This installation guide is for the LATEST VERSION of both GAME and PATCHER that patcher supports:
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bladistay/Subway-Builder-map-patcher.git
    cd Subway-Builder-map-patcher
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## üïπÔ∏è Usage
**1. Replace your system values in config**

Locate the config.js file in the program folder and open it in any text editor.
Replace these values in the file:
```js
const config = {
    // Specify the path to Subway Builder game
    "location": "C://Users/YOUR_USER/AppData/Local/Programs/Subway Builder/Subway Builder.exe", // for Windows
    // "location": "/usr/bin/subway-builder",                          // for Linux
    // "location": "/Applications/Subway Builder.app",                 // for macOS
    
    // Specify your operating system
    "platform": "windows", // or "linux", or "macos"
```

**2. Add Cities to the config**

üéØ How to Find City Coordinates:

Open the website bboxfinder.com

Select the "Rectangle" tool in the top left corner

Draw around your city ‚Äî simply create a rectangle around the city area

Copy the numbers next to the "Box" label at the bottom of the page

Coordinate example: ```-79.405575,43.641169,-79.363003,43.663029```

üìù Add a City to Configuration:
```js
"places": [
    {
        "code": "NYC",        // 3-letter code (e.g., main airport code)
        "name": "New York",   // City name
        "description": "The Big Apple", // Description
        "bbox": [-74.2591,40.4774,-73.7004,40.9176], // Coordinates
        "population": 8419000 // Population
    }
],
```
**3. Replace your tiles server values in config**

üÜì Option 1. MapTiler Cloud (Recommended)

Get your free API key at [Maptiler](https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/keys/).
```js
    //Change this value to api.maptiler.com if not
    "tileServerDomain": "api.maptiler.com",
    //Replace your own api key from maptiler instead of YOUR_MAPTILER_KEY
    "tileServerUrl": "https://api.maptiler.com/tiles/v3-openmaptiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf?key=YOUR_MAPTILER_KEY"
};
```

üñ•Ô∏è Option 2. Self-Hosted Tile Server
```js
    //Paste your own domain here to bypass the network block in the game (like this: stepan-skuratov.ru)
    "tileServerDomain": "localhost",
    //Paste your own domain here to get tiles from your server
    "tileServerUrl": "http://localhost:8080/data/v3/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf"
};
```

**4. Run the processing scripts in terminal**
```bash
# Download map data
node scripts/download-maps.js

# Process the downloaded data
node scripts/process-data.js

# Patch the game files
node scripts/patch-game.js
```

**It is NORMAL that scripts don't output anything during execution** - this is expected behavior:

‚úÖ No output = Everything is working correctly, wait till command prompt reappear and launch next script

‚ùå Only errors are displayed - if something goes wrong

‚ö†Ô∏è Some scripts may take several minutes with no visual feedback

**5. Enjoy the game**

Once all scripts finish successfully, check the build/ directory for your patched game files ready for distribution.
You also can see the unpacked version in the root of patcher.
